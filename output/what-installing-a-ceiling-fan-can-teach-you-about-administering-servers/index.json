The motor was totally dead but at least the lights still worked. However, in Texas, if the motor isn't running, no air is moving and the fan is worthless. Replacing the fan wouldn't be an easy task: our living room is 14 feet tall (that's about 4.3 meters) and our replacement fan was a pretty heavy one. Add in an almost-two-year-old running around the living room during the process and it gets a little tougher.",
