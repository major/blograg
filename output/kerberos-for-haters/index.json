Enabling pre-authentication requires that clients send a request containing a timestamp encrypted with the user's password prior to asking for a TGT.

Pre-authentication forces the client to send a timestamped request encrypted with the user's password back to the KDC before they can ask for a TGT. This means the attacker is forced to try different passwords when encrypting the timestamp in the hopes that they'll get a TGT to work with eventually. One would hope that you have something configured on the KDC to set off an alarm for multiple failed pre-authentication attempts.",
