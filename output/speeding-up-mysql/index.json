If you jump up to the SMP or hugemem kernel (in ES 2.1, you need the hugemem kernel for this to work), you can allocate 3GB per process. There is a caveat - MySQL can only use 2GB per buffer in 32-bit land. In a 64-bit OS with an appropriate Redhat kernel, you can allocate much larger buffers, and this can be tremendously helpful to tables which use the InnoDB engine. The memory allocation abilities are a great benefit, but also keep in mind that you will also get a boost in math performance within MySQL due to the 64-bit architecture. It's a win-win!",
